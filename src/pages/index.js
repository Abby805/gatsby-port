          <p>I led the theming effort for this Drupal 8 multisite featuring e-commerce integration, internationalization (i18n) for multiple languages, and numerous unique content types and views. Additionally, I had the opportunity to train the client's in-house development team, who were unfamiliar with Drupal, on how to leverage the theme for future additions to the multisite. I also performed extensive site-building and limited custom module development.</p>

          <p>This project, another Drupal 8 build with e-commerce integration, was already partially underway when I was brought onto the team to finish some of the more challenging theming tasks. My primary tasks included refining theme-level javascript interactions, improving consistency across components, and integrating and theming libraries such as algolia search.</p>

Over time, I site-built and themed numerous new components, rebuilt the header, footer, and other global elements, and refactored much of the codebase as I went.</p>
